# 구성 관리자

구성관리자(Conf) 탭에서 AndroidAPS의 여러기능들을 구성할 수 있습니다. 좌측의 박스를 선택하면 사용하고자 하는 기능을 활성화 할수 있습니다. 우측의 박스는 AndroidAPS에서 이 기능을 탭으로 볼 수 있도록 합니다. 우측 박스가 활성화되지 않은 경우, 당신은 화면 좌측 상단에 있는 hamburger 메뉴를 이용함으로써 그 기능을 이용할 수 있습니다.

모듈내에 있는 추가 세팅이 가능한 데에서, 당신은 메뉴 내 특정세팅을 할수 있는 톱니바퀴를 클릭할 수 있습니다.

첫번째 구성관리자: AAPS 2.0 설치마법사가 AndroidAPS 설치에 관한 프로세스를 통해 당신을 안내할 것 입니다. 화면 우측 상단에 점3개 메뉴를 누르시고, 설치마법사를 선택해주십시오.

## 프로파일

당신이 사용하기 원하는 기저 프로파일을 선택해주십시오. 추가적인 설치정보를 원하시면, 프로파일 페이지를 보시기 바랍니다.

### 로컬 프로파일 (권장사항)

로컬프로필은 폰에 수동으로 입력된 기저 인슐린 프로필을 활용합니다. 일단 그것이 선택되면, AAPS에 새로운 탭이 나타나게 됩니다. 필요하다면 그 탭 내에서 펌프로부터 추출된 프로파일 데이터를 바꿀 수 있습니다. 다음 프로파일로 바꾸면, 그 데이터들은 프로파일1에 있는 펌프에 작성될 것입니다. 이러한 로컬 프로파일 활용은 권장됩니다. 왜냐하면 이것은 인터넷연결에 지장을 받지않기 때문입니다.

Advantage:

* no internet connection neccessary to change profile settings
* profile changes can be made directly on the phone

Disadvantage:

* only one profile

### NS프로파일

NS프로파일은 당신의 NightScout 사이트 저장된 프로파일들을 사용합니다. 여러 프로파일들 중에 하나를 선택하기 위해서는 '프로파일 변경' 메뉴를 사용할 수 있고 AndroidAPS가 제대로 동작하지 않을 경우 현재 선택된 프로파일이 펌프에서 동작합니다. 이것은 Nightscout에서 다양한 프로파일들을 쉽게 만들 수 있도록 합니다 (예를 들어 직장에서, 가정에서, 운동할때, 휴가를 보낼 시 등등 ) 프로파일을 작성하고 "저장" 버튼을 누르면, 당신의 스마트폰이 인터넷에 연결될 때, 그 저장된 프로파일들은 AAPS로 전송이 될 것입니다. Even without an Internet connection or without a connection to Nightscout, the Nightscout profiles are available in AAPS once they have been synchronized.

Do a **profile switch** to activate a profile from Nightscout. Press and hold the current profile in the AAPS homescreen at the top (grey field between the light blue "Open/Closed Loop" field and the dark blue target area field) > Profile switch > Select profile > OK. AAPS also writes the selected profile into the pump after the profile change, so that it is available without AAPS in an emergency and continues to run.

Advantage:

* multiple profiles
* easy to edit via PC or tablet

Disadvantage:

* no local changes to profile settings
* profile cannot be changed directly on the phone

### Simple profile

Simple profile with just one time block for DIA, IC, ISF, basal rate and target range (i.e. no basal rate changes during the day). More likely to be used for testing purposes unless you have the same factors over 24 hours. Once "Simple Profile" is selected, a new tab will appear in AAPS where you can enter the profile data.

## 인슐린

Select the type of insulin curve you are using. The options 'Rapid-Acting Oref', Ultra-Rapid Oref' and 'Free-Peak Oref' all have an exponential shape. More information is listed in the [OpenAPS docs](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While%20You%20Wait%20For%20Gear/understanding-insulin-on-board-calculations.html#understanding-the-new-iob-curves-based-on-exponential-activity-curves), the curves will vary based on the DIA and the time to peak. The DIA should always be at least 5 hours, you can read more about that in the Insulin Profile section of [this](../Getting-Started/Screenshots.md) page. For Rapid-Acting and Ultra-Rapid, the DIA is the only variable you can adjust by yourself, the time to peak is fixed. Free-Peak allows you to adjust both the DIA and the time to peak, and must only be used by advanced users who know the effects of these settings. The insulin curve graph helps you to understand the different curves. You can view it by enabling the tickbox to show it as a tab, otherwise it will be in the hamburger menu.

### Rapid-Acting Oref

* recommended for Humalog, Novolog and Novorapid
* DIA = at least 5.0h
* Max. peak = 75 minutes after injection

### Ultra-Rapid Oref

* recommended for FIASP
* DIA = at least 5.0h
* Max. peak = 55 minutes after injection

For a lot of people there is practically no noticeable effect of FIASP after 3-4 hours any more, even if 0.0xx units are available as a rule then. This residual amount can still be noticeable during sports, for example. Therefore AndroidAPS uses minimum 5h as DIA.

![Config Builder Ultra-Rapid Oref](../images/ConfBuild_UltraRapidOref.png)

### Free Peak Oref

With the "Free Peak 0ref" profile you can individually enter the peak time. The DIA is automatically set to 5 hours if it is not specified higher in the profile.

This effect profile is recommended if an unbacked insulin or a mixture of different insulins is used.

## 혈당정보

Select the blood glucose source you are using - see [BG Source](BG-Source.rst) page for more setup information.

* [xDrip+](https://xdrip-plus-updates.appspot.com/stable/xdrip-plus-latest.apk)
* NSClient BG
* [MM640g](https://github.com/pazaan/600SeriesAndroidUploader/releases)
* [Glimp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.ct.glicemia&hl=de)
* [Dexcom G5 app (patched)](https://github.com/dexcomapp/dexcomapp/) - Select 'Send BG data to xDrip+' if you want tu use xDrip+ alarms. ![Config Builder BG source](../images/ConfBuild_BGSource.png)
* [Poctech](http://www.poctechcorp.com/en/contents/268/5682.html)

## 펌프

Select the pump you are using.

* [DanaR (다나알)](DanaR-Insulin-Pump.md)
* DanaR Korean (for domestic DanaR pump)
* DanaRv2 (DanaR pump with firmware upgrade)
* [DanaRS(다나알에스)](DanaRS-Insulin-Pump.md)
* [Accu Chek Combo Pump](Accu-Chek-Combo-Pump.md) (requires ruffy installation)
* MDI (receive AAPS suggestions for your multiple daily injections thereapy)
* Virtual pump (open loop for pump which don't have any driver yet - AAPS suggestions only)

Use **Advanced settings** to activate BT watchdog if necessary. It switches off bluetooth for one second if no connection to the pump is pobbile. This may help on some phones where the bluetooth stack freezes.

## 민감도 설정

Select the type of sensitivity detection. This will analyse historical data on the go and make adjustments if it recognizes that you are reacting more sensitively (or conversely, more resistant) to insulin than usual. Details about the Sensitivity Oref0 algorithm can be read in the [OpenAPS docs](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/advanced-features.html#auto-sensitivity-mode).

You can view your sensistivity on the homescreen by selecting SEN and watching the white line. Note, you need to be in [Objective 6](../Usage/Objectives) in order to use Sensitivity Detection/autosens.

### Absorption settings

If you use Oref1 with SMB you must change **min_5m_carbimpact** to 8. The value is only used during gaps in CGM readings or when physical activity "uses up" all the blood glucose rise that would otherwise cause AAPS to decay COB. At times when carb absorption can't be dynamically worked out based on your bloods reactions it inserts a default decay to your carbs. Basically it is a failsafe.

## APS

Select the desired APS algorithm for therapy adjustments. You can view the active detail of the chosen algorithm in the OpenAPS(OAPS) tab.

* OpenAPS MA (meal assist, state of the algorithm in 2016)
* OpenAPS AMA (advanced meal assist, state of the algorithm in 2016)  
    More detail about OpenAPS AMA can be found in the [OpenAPS docs](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Customize-Iterate/autosens.html#advanced-meal-assist-or-ama). In simple terms the benefits are after you give yourself a meal bolus the system can high-temp more quickly IF you enter carbs reliably.  
    Note you need to be in [Objective 7](../Usage/Objectives.md) in order to use OpenAPS AMA.
* [OpenAPS SMB](../Usage/Open-APS-features.md) (super micro bolus, most recent algorithm for advanced users)  
    Note you need to be in [Objective 8](../Usage/Objectives.md) in order to use OpenAPS SMB and min_5m_carbimpact must be set to 8 in Config builder > Sensitivity detection > Sensitivity Oref1 settings.

## Loop

Define whether you want to allow AAPS automatic controls or not.

### Open Loop

AAPS continuously evaluates all available data (IOB, COB, BG...) and makes treatment suggestions on how to adjust your therapy if necessary. The suggestions will not be executed automatically (as in closed loop) have to be entered manually into the pump or by using a button in case you are using a compatible pump (Dana R/RS or Accu Chek Combo). This option is for getting to know how AndroidAPS works or if you are using an unsupported pump.

### Closed Loop

AAPS continuously evaluates all available data (IOB, COB, BG...) and automatically adjusts the treatment if necessary (i.e. without further intervention by you) to reach the set target range or value (bolus delivery, temporary basal rate, insulin switch-off to avoid hypoversion, etc.). The Closed Loop works within numerous safety limits, which you can be set individually. Closed Loop is only possible if you are in [Objective 4](../Usage/Objectives.md) or higher and use a supported pump.

## Objectives (learning program)

AndroidAPS has a number of objectives that you have to fulfill step by step. This should guide you safely through setting up a closed loop system. It guarantees that you have set everything up correctly and understand what the system does exactly. This is the only way you can trust the system.

You should export your settings (including progress of the objectives) on a regulary basis. In case you have to replace your smartphone later (new purchase, display damage etc.) you can simply import those settings.

See [Objectives](../Usage/Objectives.md) page for more information.

## 관리

If you view the Treatments (Treat) tab, you can see the treatments that have been uploaded to nightscout. Should you wish to edit or delete an entry (e.g. you ate less carbs than you expected) then select 'Remove' and enter the new value (change the time if necessary) through the Careportal (CP) tab.

## 일반적인 정보.

### 개요

Displays the current state of your loop and buttons for most common actions (see [section The Homescreen](../Getting-Started/Screenshots.md) for details). Settings can be accessed by clicking the cog wheel.

#### Keep screen on

Option 'Keep screen on' will force Android to keep the screen on at all times. This is useful for presentations etc. But it consumes a lot of battery power. Therefore it is recommended to connect the smartphone to a charger cable.

#### Buttons

Define which Buttons are shown on the home screen.

* 관리
* Calculator
* 인슐린
* Carbs
* CGM (opens xDrip+)
* Calibration

Furthermore you can set shortcuts for insulin and carb increments and decide wether the notes field should be shown in treatment dialogues.

#### QuickWizard settings

Create a button for a certain standard meal (carbs and calculation method for the bolus) which will be displayed on the home screen. Use for standard meals frequently eaten. If different times are specified for the different meals you will always have the appropriate standard meal button on the home screen, depending on the time of day.

Note: Button will not be visible if outside the specified time range or if you have enough IOB to cover the carbs defined in the QuickWizard button.

![QuickWizard button](../images/ConfBuild_QuickWizard.png)

#### Advanced settings

Enable super bolus functionality in wizard. Use with caution and do not enable until you learn what it really does. Basically the basal for the next two hours is added to the bolus and a two hour zero-temp activated. **AAPS looping functions will be disabled - so use with care! If you use SMB AAPS looping functions will be disabled according to your settings in ["Max minutes of basal to limit SMB to"](../Usage/Open-APS-features#max-minutes-of-basal-to-limit-smb-to), if you do not use SMB looping functions will be disabled for two hours.** Details on super bolus can be found [here](https://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes-technology/blue-skying/super-bolus).

### Actions

Some buttons to quickly access common features:

* Profiles Switch (see [Profiles page](../Usage/Profiles.md) for more setup information)
* Temporary targets
* Set / cancel temp. basal rate
* Extended bolus (DanaR/RS or Combo pump only)
* Prime / fill (DanaR/RS or Combo pump only)
* History browser
* TDD (Total daily dose = bolus + basal per day)

Some doctors use - especially for new pumpers - a basal-bolus-ratio of 50:50. Therefore ratio is calculated as TDD / 2 * TBB (Total base basal = sum of basal rate within 24 hours). Others prefer range of 32% to 37% of TDD for TBB. Like most of these rules-of-thumb it is of limited real validity. Note: Your diabetes may vary!

![Actions tab](../images/ConfBuild_ConfBuild_Actions.png)

### Careportal

Allows you to record any specific care entries and view the current sensor, insulin, canula and pump battery ages in the Careportal (CP) tab.

Note: **No insulin** will be given if entered via careportal (i.e. meal bolus, correction bolus...)

Carbs entered in the careportal (i.e. correction carbs) will be used for COB calculation.

![Careportal tab](../images/ConfBuild_CarePortal.png)

### SMS Communicator

Allows remote caregivers to control some AndroidAPS features via SMS, see [SMS Commands](../Usage/SMS-Commands.md) for more setup information.

### Food

Displays the food presets defined in the Nightscout food database, see [Nightscout Readme](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor#food-custom-foods) for more setup information.

Note: Entries cannot be used in the AndroidAPS calculator. (View only)

### Wear

Monitor and control AAPS using your Android Wear watch (see [page Watchfaces](../Configuration/Watchfaces.md)). Use settings (cog wheel) to define which variables should be considered when calculating bolus given though your watch (i.e. 15min trend, COB...).

If you want to bolus etc from the watch then within "Wear settings" you need to enable "Controls from Watch".

![Wear settings](../images/ConfBuild_Wear.png)

Through Wear tab or hamburger menu (top left of screen, if tab is not displayed) you can

* Resend all data. Might be helpful if watch was not connected for some time and you want to push the information to the watch.
* Open settings on your watch directly from your phone.

### xDrip Statusline (watch)

Display loop information on your xDrip+ watchface (if you are not using AAPS/[AAPSv2 watchface](../Configuration/Watchfaces.md)

### Ongoing Notification

Displays a summary of current BG, delta, active TBR%, active basal u/hr and profile, IOB and split into bolus IOB and basal IOB on the phones dropdown screen and phonelock screen.

![AAPS widget](../images/ConfBuild_Widget.png)

### NS Client

Setup sync of your AndroidAPS data with Nightscout.

If **Log app start to NS** is activated each AndroidAPS will be visible in Nightscout. Might be useful to detect problems with the app (i.e. battery optimisation not disabled for AAPS) but can flood the Nightscout graph with entries.

#### Alarm options

Activate/deactivate AndroidAPS alarms

![Alarm options](../images/ConfBuild_NSClient_Alarms.png)

#### Connection settings

Offline looping, disable roaming...

If you want to use only a specific WiFi network you can enter its **WiFi SSID **. Several SSIDs can be separated by semicolon. To delete all SSIDs enter a blank space in the field.

![Nightscout connection settings](../images/ConfBuild_ConnectionSettings.png)

#### Advanced settings

* Auto backfill missing BGs from Nightscout
* Create announcement from errors Create Nightscout announcement fro error dialogs and local alerts (also viewable in careportal in treatments section)
* Enable local broadcast to other apps like xDrip+
* NS upload only (sync disabled)
* No upload to NS
* Always use basal absolute values -> Must be activated if you want to use [Autotune](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Customize-Iterate/autotune.html) properly.
