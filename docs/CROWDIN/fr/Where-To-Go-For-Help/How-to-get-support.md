# How to get support

**Level 1:** Wiki - we now have a search function!

**Level 2:** [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndroidAPSUsers/) OR [gitter](https://gitter.im/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS)

**Level 3:** Gitter (if FB did not get results, wait at least a couple of hours (plural)!!! Direct crossposts will be ignored/deleted on both channels!!!)

**Level 4:** Create an issue with logs and time of the issue

**Level 5:** PM (only if personal data is involved that should not go in a public channel)
